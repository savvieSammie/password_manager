# password_manager
A password manager written in python. The app can help you
store your passwords, organize them with the username and passwords associated with it.

NB: this project was done to improve my learning of python concepts, so this app
should not be used as a substiitue for a secure password manager, though the passwords are encrypted but
they can easily be deencrypted these days.
 
 
 **Encryption** : used cryptography library, read more about the library here: [Cryptography Library](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) 
### New things I learnt:

**rstrip()** this methods removes the characters at the end of a string. syntax: `string.rstrip(characters)` . parameter - 'character' is a string(s) to
remove as trailing characters.
