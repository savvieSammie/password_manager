# password_manager
A password manager written in python. The app can help you
store your passwords, organize them with the username and passwords associated with it.

NB: this project was done to improve my learning of python concepts, so this app
should not be used as a substiitue for a secure password manager, though the passwords are encrypted but
they can easily be deencrypted these days.
